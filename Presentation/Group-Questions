For part 4:
Were there any decisions that created extra work for us?
    - schema issues-- had to undo/rethink first schema including seq models

Did any of our decisions constrain future decisions?
    - Our choice to not let guests checkout led to time spent working with permissions/alerts/toast notifications.

Did any up-front investments pay dividends down the line? (or probably would w/ a longer project?)
    - Having all of Jamie's routes early made everything else easy

What decision took the longest to make?
    - Schema (cart organization)

Is there anything you'd do differently with a do-over?
    - Spend a lot of time with the schema up front before doing anything else so as to only do it once
    - More focus on project management/communication

For part 5:
Did you have a particular learning moment?
    - Every day!
    - When Alexandra helped us set up our project board was a big deal

What successful practices did you implement?
    - Daily tracker
    - Well-kept project board
    - Frequent merges

What would you do differently on your next collaboration?
    - More intensive breakdown of needs/tasks-- even more specific with wants/needs
